# This is a Binary Search Tree assignment. 
# I'll explain how my BST works so it is easy to follow along.
You’re making a special box for storing people’s information (like their name, ID, and salary). 

This box is called a Binary Search Tree — it’s like a smart tree that keeps everything in order so you can find things quickly.

You build the tree so it can add new people, find someone by their ID, and show the whole tree in a neat way.

You also make an Employee card that holds each person’s details.

Then you write a program that reads a list of employees from a file and puts them into the tree.

If the same person shows up twice, the program says “Nope, that’s a duplicate!” and doesn’t add them again.

Finally, you can type in an employee’s ID to look them up, and the program will show all their info — or tell you if they’re not in the tree.
